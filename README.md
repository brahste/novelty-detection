# Novelty Detector

A repository for the code used to conduct a suite of novelty detection algorithms on a variety of datasets. Generally speaking, this repo is structured such that the **experiments** folder contains the main research scripts (more details can be found in the experiments/README file). Each experiment uses a single **module**, which is a self-contained, plug-and-play class with all the attributes and methods needed to run the experiment. A module is parameterized by a **model** and a **dataset**, further defining the type of experiment being carried out. For example, the `trainer_cae_reference` experiment imports the `CAEBaseModule`, which takes as arguments the `ReferenceCAE` model and `LunarAnalogueDataModule` dataset. Another experiment may be created, called `trainer_cae_vgg16`, which also employs the `CAEBaseModule` but plugs in the `VGG16CAE` model instead. Or another still that uses the `PCABaseModule`, `IncrementalPCA` model, and the`LunarAnalogueDataGenerator`, which loads data into CPU memory. Similar changes can be made for any of the various models and datasets; the compatability of different modules, models, and datasets are tabulated in the modules/README file.
