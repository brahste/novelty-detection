# Experiments

## Understanding the Experiments

Most experiments are broken down into the following sections:

- Imports and Configuration

- Evaluation

- Analysis

### Models

- Once trained, a model is placed in the *logs/* folder under the datamodule they were trained with.

- Models that are kept for long-term reference are renamed with the naming convention: *archived_vX_yyyy-mm-dd*. Where the *X* is the version number.
