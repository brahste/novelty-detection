Experiments perform the role of packaging the model, dataset, and 
any monitoring, serializing, or visualizations tools. Make as many experiments as you
like. Use them to standardize differences between inputs and outputs of different
techniques. Don't be afraid to be explicit in your experiment names, better the know
what is it than save a few key strokes.
